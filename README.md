## Eaglercraft-Server-Paper Pterodactyl EGG

A Pterodactyl EGG for "Universal Eaglercraft server (1.5, 1.8, 1.12) using Paper 1.12.2"
*Forked from https://github.com/Eaglercraft-Templates/Eaglercraft-Server-Paper*

Download the **egg-eaglercraft-paper-universal.json** and import it to your Pelican/Pyrodactyl/Pterodactyl/ETC panel and it should work first try.
On the Eaglercraft client, just add a new server with wss://*your-ip:port*.

You can also download the EaglerMOTD plugin to animate your server's MOTD, and the EaglerWeb plugin to host a website from your server, both of which are available here [https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglerxserver/releases](https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglerxserver/releases)

**Note:** If you would like to support versions of Eaglercraft 1.5 older than 22w34a (before singleplayer), add `-Deaglerxrewind.oldChunkFormat=true` to the JVM arguments in the run script. This will perform worse for both clients and the server, but will be compatible with every version of 1.5 going back to 2020.
